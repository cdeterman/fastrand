Type: Package
Title: Fast Random Number Generation
Version: 0.1-0
Description: Fast uniform and gaussian (normal) random number generation. The
    package uses the thrust library, which can be built to support a threaded
    backend via 'OpenMP' or Intel Thread Building Blocks ('TBB'), as well as a
    'GPU' backend via 'NVIDIA''s 'CUDA'.  The package is particularly useful for
    generating very large vectors for testing numerical algorithms.
